                                            <b>Title: XAI for the Sciences: towards understanding</b>
                                            <br>
                                            In recent years, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence 
                                            (AI) methods have begun to play a more and more enabling role 
                                            in the sciences and in industry. In particular, the advent of large 
                                            and/or complex data corpora has given rise to new technological 
                                            challenges and possibilities. In his talk, Müller will first 
                                            introduce explainable AI techniques and touch upon the topic of 
                                            ML applications in the sciences. He will also discuss possibilities 
                                            for extracting information from machine learning models to further 
                                            our understanding by explaining nonlinear ML models. E.g. Machine 
                                            Learning Models for Quantum Chemistry can, by applying XAI, contribute 
                                            to furthering chemical understanding. Finally, Müller will briefly 
                                            outline perspectives and limitations.

                                            <br>
                                            Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), including deep 
                                            learning (DL), continue to transform the world around us.  However, 
                                            in order to avoid the risk of "plateauing out", we need to make the 
                                            next leap. In this talk, I will provide an overview of some exciting 
                                            work we've been doing to design cutting-edge technologies and push the 
                                            boundaries of  what can be achieved with AI/ML/DL in several important 
                                            domains such as biopharma, IoT, quantum computing, multiagent systems, 
                                            and e-commerce. I'll also mention relevant research being conducted at FCAI.

                                            For the benefit of our audience - both within academia and industry - I'll 
                                            present several motivating examples from recent AI/ML/DL success stories, and 
                                            sketch how critically dissecting the (complex) problems of interest for scientists

                                            <br>
                                            In recent years, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence 
                                            (AI) methods have begun to play a more and more enabling role 
                                            in the sciences and in industry. In particular, the advent of large 
                                            and/or complex data corpora has given rise to new technological 
                                            challenges and possibilities. In his talk, Müller will first 
                                            introduce explainable AI techniques and touch upon the topic of 
                                            ML applications in the sciences. He will also discuss possibilities 
                                            for extracting information from machine learning models to further 
                                            our understanding by explaining nonlinear ML models. E.g. Machine 
                                            Learning Models for Quantum Chemistry can, by applying XAI, contribute 
                                            to furthering chemical understanding. Finally, Müller will briefly 
                                            outline perspectives and limitations.

                                            <br>
                                            Artificial intelligence (AI) can create a vast number of physical and intangible systems already
                                            today. Increasingly, tasks and jobs traditionally done by natural persons in various fields will
                                            be fulfilled by these non-human entities. These automated or semi-automated activities have
                                            vast financial and legal consequences, pointing to the fact that the less meaningful human
                                            control, the greater the need for regulating AI entities. Besides efficiency, these developments
                                            raise several fundamental questions pertaining to one of the most important legal fields that
                                            regulate these types of innovations, namely intellectual property law (IP, IPR). To what extend
                                            is it allowed, acceptable or even desirable that AI-generated innovations are protected by some
                                            form of IPR? What about IPR infringements caused partly or even entirely by AI agents? What
                                            kind of legal and ethical considerations are to be taken into account in this assessment? By
                                            placing the study in the context of AI-generated innovations and IPR, the presentation
                                            investigates issues related to IP protection and infringement, as well as the need for regulating
                                            (or not) AI actors as legal subjects, including the feasibility for having AI as legal persons for
                                            IPR purposes.

                                            Since 2005, she has researched and taught in the field of IP law at various universities. 
                                            Prof. Rosa's research interests focus on the interface between law (with focus on IP law), technology 
                                            and sustainability. Currently, she also investigates issues related to the role of empathy in law 
                                            and decision making. She has written extensively especially in the fields of patent and copyright 
                                            law, open innovation and open source, as well as IP strategies and IP management in various technological 
                                            contexts such as software, 3D printing, artificial intelligence and industrial internet. Her research 
                                            approach is multidisciplinary, combining law, technology, business and policy via using different types 
                                            of methodologies (e.g. traditional legal research methods, empirical methods and design thinking in legal studies).

                                            <br>
                                            Artificial Intelligence has become impactful during the last 
                                            few years in chemistry and the life sciences, pushing the scientific 
                                            boundaries forward as exemplified by the recent success of AlphaFold2. 
                                            In this presentation, I will provide an overview of how AI has 
                                            impacted drug design in the last few years, where we are now and 
                                            what progress we can reasonably expect in the coming years. The 
                                            presentation will have a focus on deep learning based molecular de novo 
                                            design, however, also aspects of synthesis prediction, molecular property 
                                            predictions and chemistry automation will be covered.

                                            <br>
                                            While deep learning models have become increasingly accurate over the 
                                            last decade, concerns about their (lack of) interpretability have 
                                            taken a center stage. In response, a growing subfield on interpretability 
                                            and analysis of these models has emerged. While hundreds of techniques have 
                                            been proposed to “explain” predictions of models, what aims these explanations 
                                            serve and how they ought to be evaluated are often unstated. In this 
                                            talk, I will present a proposal to quantify the value of explanations, which 
                                            draws upon argumentative theories of human reasoning that posit that (effective) 
                                            explanations communicate how the decisions are made, and can help people 
                                            predict how later decisions will be made.

                                            <b>Title: Explicitising the implicit interpretability of DNNs</b>
                                            <br>
                                            Deep neural networks (DNNs) are still largely considered to be black 
                                            boxes. Recent past has seen two kinds of efforts (i) to 'explain' 
                                            the decisions of DNNs via simpler models  in a post-hoc manner and 
                                            (ii) to make the DNNs interpretable by design. In this backdrop, 
                                            we look at DNNs with rectified linear units (ReLUs) through the lens 
                                            of the dual view which we developed in our recent work. The dual view 
                                            provides an analytical/empirical framework to understand the gates and 
                                            the weights separately. <br><br>
                                            
                                            Using the dual view:
                                            <br>
                                            - we show most important information is learnt in the gates (i.e., on/off states), 
                                            <br>
                                            - we show that it is unnecessary to interpret the computations in the weights
                                            <br>
                                            - we argue that the main function of the weights is in dual lifting, whereby the information in 
                                            the layers gets lifted to the space of paths. 
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            We explicitise the role of dual lifting by considering a new class of model called 
                                            'Deep Linearly Gated Networks', wherein, the pre-activations (to gates) are generated 
                                            without using any non-linear activations, and then the weights are used to dual lift 
                                            pre-activations. We show via experiments (on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) that  DLGN counterparts 
                                            of state-of-the-art DNNs perform almost as well as the DNNs.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            We conclude by saying that 
                                            <br>
                                            (i) dual lifting is implicit in standard DNNs with ReLUs, 
                                            and seen this way one can attribute the success of standard DNNs to dual lifting. 
                                            <br>

                                            <b>Title: Learning to Predict Drug Combination Responses</b>
                                            <br>
                                            Combinatorial treatments involving two or more drugs have become a 
                                            standard of care for various complex diseases, including tuberculosis, 
                                            malaria, HIV and other viral infections, as well as most of the advanced 
                                            cancers. High-throughput screening in preclinical model systems (e.g. 
                                            cancer cell lines or viral infection models) is the state-of-the-art approach 
                                            to systematically identify candidate drug combinations. However, due to the 
                                            exponential number of possible drug combinations and the extensive heterogeneity 
                                            of the target systems, computational methods, and in particular, machine learning, 
                                            are critically needed to guide the discovery of effective combinations to be 
                                            prioritized for further pre-clinical validation and clinical development.

                                            <br>
                                            In this talk, I present our recent work on a highly accurate machine learning framework 
                                            for predicting the responses of drug combinations in preclinical studies. Our  methods 
                                            model the cell context-specific drug interactions through higher-order tensors, and 
                                            efficiently learns latent factors of the tensor using 
                                            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19950-z" target="_blank">powerful factorization machines</a> 
                                            and 
                                            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab308" target="_blank">latent tensor reconstruction</a>. 
                                            The approach enables our methods to leverage information from previous experiments performed on 
                                            similar drugs and cells when predicting responses of new combinations in so far untested cells; 
                                            thereby, it achieves highly accurate predictions despite sparsely populated data tensors. 
                                            In conclusion, the presentation discusses the open challenges and potential extensions of the methods.

                                            standard of care for various complex diseases, including tuberculosis, 
                                            malaria, HIV and other viral infections, as well as most of the advanced 
                                            cancers. High-throughput screening in preclinical model systems (e.g. 
                                            cancer cell lines or viral infection models) is the state-of-the-art approach 
                                            to systematically identify candidate drug combinations. However, due to the 
                                            exponential number of possible drug combinations and the extensive heterogeneity 
                                            of the target systems, computational methods, and in particular, machine learning, 
                                            are critically needed to guide the discovery of effective combinations to be 
                                            prioritized for further pre-clinical validation and clinical development.

                                            In this talk, I present our recent work on a highly accurate machine learning framework 
                                            for predicting the responses of drug combinations in preclinical studies. Our  methods 
                                            model the cell context-specific drug interactions through higher-order tensors, and 
                                            efficiently learns latent factors of the tensor using

                                            and

                                            The approach enables our methods to leverage information from previous experiments performed on 
                                            similar drugs and cells when predicting responses of new combinations in so far untested cells; 
                                            thereby, it achieves highly accurate predictions despite sparsely populated data tensors. 
                                            In conclusion, the presentation discusses the open challenges and potential extensions of the methods.

                                            The approach enables our methods to leverage information from previous experiments performed on 
                                            similar drugs and cells when predicting responses of new combinations in so far untested cells; 
                                            thereby, it achieves highly accurate predictions despite sparsely populated data tensors. 
                                            In conclusion, the presentation discusses the open challenges and potential extensions of the methods.
