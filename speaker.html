                                            <b>Title: Legal and Ethical Considerations with AI-Generated Innovations</b>
                                            <br>
                                            Artificial intelligence (AI) can create a vast number of physical and intangible systems already
                                            today. Increasingly, tasks and jobs traditionally done by natural persons in various fields will
                                            be fulfilled by these non-human entities. These automated or semi-automated activities have
                                            vast financial and legal consequences, pointing to the fact that the less meaningful human
                                            control, the greater the need for regulating AI entities. Besides efficiency, these developments
                                            raise several fundamental questions pertaining to one of the most important legal fields that
                                            regulate these types of innovations, namely intellectual property law (IP, IPR). To what extend
                                            is it allowed, acceptable or even desirable that AI-generated innovations are protected by some
                                            form of IPR? What about IPR infringements caused partly or even entirely by AI agents? What
                                            kind of legal and ethical considerations are to be taken into account in this assessment? By
                                            placing the study in the context of AI-generated innovations and IPR, the presentation
                                            investigates issues related to IP protection and infringement, as well as the need for regulating
                                            (or not) AI actors as legal subjects, including the feasibility for having AI as legal persons for
                                            IPR purposes.

                                            Rosa Maria Ballardini is Professor of IP law and Vice Dean (research) at the University of Lapland, 
                                            Faculty of Law. She holds a PhD from Hanken School of Economics, Finland (2012), 
                                            an LLM in IT and IP law from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland (2005) and a law degree 
                                            from the University of Brescia, Italy (2003). In 2017 Rosa was granted the title of Docent (Docentti) 
                                            in Intellectual Property Law from the University of Helsinki. Previously - 2008 to 2009 - she was a 
                                            Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley/Boalt Hall.

                                            Since 2005, she has researched and taught in the field of IP law at various universities. 
                                            Prof. Rosa's research interests focus on the interface between law (with focus on IP law), technology 
                                            and sustainability. Currently, she also investigates issues related to the role of empathy in law 
                                            and decision making. She has written extensively especially in the fields of patent and copyright 
                                            law, open innovation and open source, as well as IP strategies and IP management in various technological 
                                            contexts such as software, 3D printing, artificial intelligence and industrial internet. Her research 
                                            approach is multidisciplinary, combining law, technology, business and policy via using different types 
                                            of methodologies (e.g. traditional legal research methods, empirical methods and design thinking in legal studies).

                                            <br>
                                            Artificial Intelligence has become impactful during the last 
                                            few years in chemistry and the life sciences, pushing the scientific 
                                            boundaries forward as exemplified by the recent success of AlphaFold2. 
                                            In this presentation, I will provide an overview of how AI has 
                                            impacted drug design in the last few years, where we are now and 
                                            what progress we can reasonably expect in the coming years. The 
                                            presentation will have a focus on deep learning based molecular de novo 
                                            design, however, also aspects of synthesis prediction, molecular property 
                                            predictions and chemistry automation will be covered.

                                            <br>
                                            While deep learning models have become increasingly accurate over the 
                                            last decade, concerns about their (lack of) interpretability have 
                                            taken a center stage. In response, a growing subfield on interpretability 
                                            and analysis of these models has emerged. While hundreds of techniques have 
                                            been proposed to “explain” predictions of models, what aims these explanations 
                                            serve and how they ought to be evaluated are often unstated. In this 
                                            talk, I will present a proposal to quantify the value of explanations, which 
                                            draws upon argumentative theories of human reasoning that posit that (effective) 
                                            explanations communicate how the decisions are made, and can help people 
                                            predict how later decisions will be made.
